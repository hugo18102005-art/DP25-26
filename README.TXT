Project: EV-Charging-Station-Simulation
Authors: Professors of the Software Development Course (Desarrollo de Programas)

This project is an adaptation of the material for the Software Development (Desarrollo de Programas) 
course at the University of Extremadura, based on the initial structure of the book:

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Sixth edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling
   Pearson Education, 2016

This project implements the simulation of a fleet of Electric Vehicles (EVs) operating on a city grid.
EVs travel from an initial location to a target destination, planning intermediate stops 
at Charging Stations if their battery level is insufficient.
The simulation also models the management of Chargers within each station.

How to start this project:
    To run the simulation, create an EVDemo object and invoke its run() method, or execute the static main() method of the EVDemo class.
